# Project Board Report

The GitHub Project Board was used to manage tasks following Agile methodology.

The board includes four columns:
- Backlog
- To Do
- In Progress
- Done

User Stories were first added to the Backlog. When work started, tasks were moved to In Progress, and after completion, they were moved to Done.

This approach helped the team visualize progress, track responsibilities, and improve collaboration.
